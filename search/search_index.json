Within a CTR, IFR aircraft are separated from special VFR (operating below visual meteorological conditions) aircraft, and special VFR aircraft are separated from each other when visibility is less than 5 km. Where separation is not being provided, air traffic controllers are required to pass appropriate traffic information to VFR aircraft about other VFR aircraft, or special VFR aircraft when visibility is less than 5 km.

For example, the MADEP transition to airway N774, Those starting the enroute phase other than at a waypoint, the \"custom\" transition. This sometimes happens on VATSIM when the flight plan omits the transition fix. In the real world, occasionally a flight requests a straight line out from the end of the SID to an unevaluated route as opposed to a named waypoint transition connecting to an airway. Those associated only with the AUCKLAND radar, EMRAG or LENGU departures - the oceanic transition. Refer to the SID chart for further information. Info To avoid confusion, associate the phrase oceanic transition only with the EMRAG, LENGU, or AUCKLAND radar departures. Examples Air New Zealand 8, cleared to Sydney via flight planned route. OSRAP1P departure, MADEP transition. Squawk 0214. Issuing STARs for short-routes Due to to the short flight distance from Auckland to Tauranga and Hamilton, aircraft departing for these locations should have the STAR added into the departure clearance. Find the duty runway, the appropriate STAR at the destination, and issue the clearance - assuming the standard route clearances are used. Examples Cleared AATG3 with the URBUX1A arrival, 12000 feet, REKIS3Q departure.. Cleared AAHN1 with the YOGIT1B arrival, 8000 feet.. VFR Departures: Assign VFR aircraft a departure procedure appropriate for the direction of flight. If the pilot is unfamiliar with a published procedure, a plain language clearance may be issued. Amend the flight strip to display the departure procedure given. VFR departures from NZAA require ATC approval to start engines. See more about VFR departures here: Auckland VFR Procedures All VFR Procedures can be found on the New Zealand AIP General Rules of Thumb: IFR Departures Tower may clear aircraft for take-off without coordinating with the departure controller, also called \"auto-release\". The departure controller may cancel auto-release during periods of high workload. Warning Radar Controllers should not be cancelling auto-release unless it is during an event or during unforecast high workload Where successive similar aircraft depart on the same SID to the same domestic destination, allow four minutes between them to avoid a sequencing problem for the radar controllers. For successive straight ahead departures, ensure the previous departure is at least 5nm off the end of the runway and above 2000 feet AGL, assuming aircraft with similar performance, e.g., jet-following jet or turboprop following turboprop. For pilots that have requested an alternative departure procedure, co-ordinate with the radar controller while the aircraft is taxiing. For example, the pilot is cleared for the LEVRA1P departure runway 23L, but requests an early turn.

Usually the outbound aircraft will take the taxiway closest to the departure runway, and the vacating traffic will take the taxiway closest to the terminating end. For example - If RWY 23 is active, aircraft will enter at A4 and exit at A3 . If RWY 05 is active, aircraft will enter at A3 and exit at A4 . General Rules of Thumb RNP Approaches There are two RNP approaches per runway - the RNP Y or RNP Z. The RNP Y is used for Approach Category C or D aircraft (jet aircraft), whereas the RNP Z is to be used for Approach Category B aircraft, such as turboprops. Information The RNP Yankee and Zulu approaches follow the same lateral path, but have differing vertical paths. For example, on the go-around for the RNP -Z 23, there are speed restrictions placed on the initial climb fixes to QN737 . This forces the aircraft to gain altitude quicker. Departures Queenstown is surrounded by significant terrain, so aircraft should stick to the departure path where possible. However, once the aircraft has climbed above the surrounding terrain, they may be cleared direct to their SID termination fix, where they can resume their filed plan. Procedure Assignment RWY 23 STARs vatSys and EuroScope will usually assign the most appropriate arrival for that aircraft's flightplan. Arrival Direction Transition Fix STAR Notes NE ELRUV ELRUV 2A WN/CH traffic. AA traffic if using AAQN4 N DOVOT UBDAM 4B / DOVOT AA traffic, if using AAQN2 SE SUNGU SUNGU 4B NV traffic W ADKOS UBDAM 4B / ADKOS Oceanic traffic NW LIBLA UBDAM 4B / LIBLA Oceanic traffic Approaches All of Runway 23's STARs terminate at either UGPED or ATKIL , which are the IAF for both the RNP and back-up RNAV approaches. Category B aircraft should be given the RNP Z, and Category C/D aircraft should be given the RNP Y. Aircraft unable to fly the RNP approaches can be issued the RNAV G or H. These approaches follow the general path of the RNP approaches, albeit with a higher profile. Both of these approaches end in visual circling segments to both runways. Heads up! If you assign the RNAV G or H approaches to aircraft, you should expect them to not follow the visual segment. This significantly limits your runway occupancy, and increases the potential for conflict. Missed Approaches The Missed Approach for both RNPs have the aircraft climb to 10,000 feet and enter a hold at SUNGU . For aircraft unable to reach this altitude, they are to continue onwards to NV , climbing to 10,000 feet. Due to the holding point also being a STAR commencement fix, aircraft may be given a SUNGU based STAR for another attempt. Departures The assignment of departures out of Queenstown is largely governed by aircraft performance. This can be either climb performance, or navigation performance. Departures out of Queenstown that have a A or B suffix are RNP departure procedures. In this case, the entirety of the departure has lateral and vertical path to ensure separation from terrain. Departures that have a D , C , F , P , Q , S or T suffix is a RNAV departure, with a visual initial climb segment. Not all aircraft that fly into Queenstown are able to perform RNP procedures, so you may choose to issue a departure that is true to real life. On the network, in reality, most pilots aren't going to mind whether or not their departure is accurate - so the replication of that is up to you.

These approaches follow the general path of the RNP approaches, albeit with a higher profile. Both of these approaches end in visual circling segments to both runways. Heads up! If you assign the RNAV G or H approaches to aircraft, you should expect them to not follow the visual segment.

This can be either climb performance, or navigation performance. Departures out of Queenstown that have a A or B suffix are RNP departure procedures. In this case, the entirety of the departure has lateral and vertical path to ensure separation from terrain. Departures that have a D , C , F , P , Q , S or T suffix is a RNAV departure, with a visual initial climb segment. Not all aircraft that fly into Queenstown are able to perform RNP procedures, so you may choose to issue a departure that is true to real life.

Tauranga can accomodate up to an A320, but usually serves Air New Zealand's turboprop fleet. Tauranga also receives regular visits from the Air Chathams fleet of aircraft, serving as a fuel stop betwen mainland New Zealand and the Chatham Islands. Layout Tauranga has four gates on the main apron and is home to over 20 private hangars. Tauranga also hosts multiple flight training organisations, which provides training for fixed wing, helicopter and gliders. Tauranga has six Runways in total. While only four are regularly used, the remainder are used when required or when special operations are in place. Runways Runway Designator Length (m) Type 07 - 25 1825 Bituminous 07 - 25 750 Grass 04 - 22 640 Grass 16 - 34 575 Grass Sealed 07/25 is always issued to aircraft with a gross weight of 5500kg or more, and can be issued to smaller aircraft on request. Gliders & helicopters are not permitted to use the sealed runway. Grass 25/07 is always issued to light aircraft with a gross weight of 5500kg or less and cannot be issued to Category B/C/D aircraft. Grass 04/22 Glider Operations Only The Airport Company has an agreement with the Gliding Club prohibiting use of Grass 04/22 for aircraft other than gliders and tow planes. Parallel Runway Operations Simultaneous parallel operations on sealed and grass runways 07/25 are permitted only for aircraft 2300 kg or less in VFR conditions and when ATC is on duty. Use of Taxiways and Holding Points Taxiway E runs parallel to Grass 07/25, for almost the entire length of the apron area. Upon landing, inbound aircraft shall be told to either taxi to the apron or hold short of the grass due to departing/arriving traffic. If the latter has to occur, the aircraft must be instructed to taxi to A1/A2 and hold short of Grass 07/25. Grass Hold Short Points There are various intermediate holding points specifically for the grass runways. Usually, these hold short points are located on hard-standing surfaces. Grass 07 - Golf Grass 25 - Foxtrot Grass 16 - W4 from the apron side, or W3 from the Sealed 07 threshold side. Sealed Hold Short Points Sealed 07/25 (from the Main Apron) - A2 or A3 Sealed 07 (light aircraft) - W1 or W2 Sealed 25 (light aircraft) - E1 or E2 Info When grass 04/22 is in use, aircraft using Taxiway W should hold short at W2 to prevent an incursion. General Rules of Thumb Movement Areas Aircraft should contact ATC before entering the movement area and should state their location after contact has been established. Aircraft who require taxi to the fuel pumps from any of the eastern hangars or Aero Club can do so without contacting ATC, provided they stay outside the Movement Area - as indicated by a dashed red line along Taxiway E. Parallel Operations If both the sealed and grass runways are occupied, and both aircraft are ready for departure, the aircraft on the grass runway should be instructed to takeoff first. This avoids the need to wait two or three minutes due to wake turbulence separation. The aircraft who departs first should be instructed to make an early turn to allow successive departure of the waiting aircraft. Crane Operation Danger Tauranga Port is Adjacent to Tauranga Airport and operates Multiple cranes up to 361 ft AMSL at 1.5 to 2.0 NM from Runway 07 Threshold.

Starting a new Category or subdirectory Let's say we want to create a new 'Military' category, here's the category setup we'd want: Main Directory / docs/ military / .pages index.md buzzandbreak.md formationflying.md .pages Within the main docs/ directory, create the new folder. The name of the folder will also be what's shown in the URL string - in this case it'll be website.xyz/military/ . Within that directory, you can see a few files. The files ending in .md are singular pages and follow the normal page conventions. The .pages file is a MkDocs specific file that tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. We'll touch base on that later. Single Page Every page starts the same way - with a title declaration and an abbreviation include. --- title: Building Blocks --- --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" The title declaration block is sets the title across a few different areas. It automatically appears at the top of the page as an h1 element, and will show in all website navigation unless overwritten by a .pages file. The --8<-- \"includes/abbreviations.md\" line pulls in the abbreviations file. This pulls in defined abbreviations, and allows for these to be shown all across the site. Hint Since the title attribute can be seen across multiple areas, so it's important that it's both short and descriptive. If the page is nested within another category, you should be able to rely on context. For example, this page is called Building Blocks . This could mean Lego, but since it's in the Assist Us section, you would be fair to assume that it contains the building blocks of a page. .pages file As eluded to before, the .pages file is a tells MkDocs how to render the navigation elements. title: Military nav: - \"Overview\": index.md - \"Buzz and Break\": buzzandbreak.md - formationflying.md - ... The title property dictates how the military/ directory is named in navigation. In this particular example, the directory is military/ , but is defined as title: Military . This doesn't change how the category is processed, only displayed. Breakdown: nav: - Dictates how items are shown, and in what order. This is mandatory. \"Overview\": index.md - \"Overview\" is a manually set title, and overrides any titles defined locally within the page itself. For the index.md page, this is shown as the index page for the directory it sits in. Once rendered, this page sits at website.xyz/military/ . \"Buzz and Break\": buzzandbreak.md - Same as above, but this file sits at website.xyz/military/buzzandbreak/ . formationflying.md - In this case, this file has a title defined within the file itself. This would be inherited into the navigation. ... - This means that all other files within the directory will be shown in alphabetical order.

When your working on these SOPs , we require you to create a new branch, that we can then merge into main . So how do we contribute a new item or section? Let's have a look! Fork the project into your personal account on GitHub. Create a new branch from main , with a clear name of what you're implementing - seen in the image on the right. Checkout your new branch, and commit some changes. Open a new Pull Request for your changes/branch. This can be done by heading to the sops repository, and finding Pull requests Click on the green button, saying New pull request Make note of the arrow! In the image to the left, you can see that the arrow shows that we're wanting to merge this-is-a-test-branch into main . After making sure the arrows are correct, click on the green Create pull request button. Make sure your title clearly explains the changes you've made, but is still concise. Fill out the main content of your PR as necessary. The main content of your PR serves as the project tracker for that feature or fix. Feel free to add in checkboxes of important steps, or whatever you need. Other people are also able to make changes to your branch, and may occasionally have some discussion on your PR .

This is incredibly handy for having different Enroute Sectors export definitions for vatSpy versus vatSys, for example. Database Overview Draw definitions follow the standard NZ eAIP method of drawing airspace, as used in the ANR . All airspace definitions are stored in the airspace table of the database. The important columns are - id - Automatically generated on import. ident - The identifier of that airspace. This is explained below. VSName , Comment - Contains the name of the airspace. Type - Airspace Type. This is explained below. ExportID - Dictates which product this airspace is exported to. This is explained below. Unique Airspace Identifiers All airspace imported into the database must have a unique ident . Airspace imported from the ANR will have their airspace designator set as the ident , so should be unique by default. It is best practice to have the Sector set as the ident , as it is easily distinguishable, without having to manually test it. Imported airspace identifiers must fit the following criteria - Enroute : NXXX , with an optional _X or -X where X can be alphanumeric. Manual FIR : NXXX , with an optional _X or -X where X can be alphanumeric. TMA : NZTnnn , with an optional _X or -X where X can be alphanumeric. where nnn is a unique sequence number. Airspace Types There are a handful of different airspace types in the database. The CFZ , MBZ , CTA , CTR , FIR , Military , Danger and Restricted areas are automatically labelled by the ANR import process. The only user configurable airspace types are ENR , MFIR and TMA . Airspace imported as ENR , MFIR or TMA will be exported to the dataset in line with the ExportID. The ENR type will be exported as an Enroute map, MFIR as a FIR map, and TMA as a TMA map. Export IDs The SFG is capable of storing multiple unique airspace definitions, and exporting them to multiple differing platforms. This is achieved through the ExportID column. Each piece of airspace is tagged with one of the following ExportID , dictating which products it is exported to - NZZC - Exported to both vatSys/ES and vatSpy VSPY - Exported only to vatSpy VSYS - Exported only to vatSys/ES NZZCVSYS - Exported only to the NZZC vatSys/ES release NZZO - Exported to the Oceanic profile and vatSpy NZZOVSYS - Exported only to the Oceanic vatSys profile NZZCNZZO - Exported to both vatSys/ES profiles, and to vatSpy. Airspace imported from the NZ ANR are automatically labelled with the NZZC ExportID. If an export ID isn't provided in the Import Limits Line, it is imported as NZZC . Format Overview Each file has a header line defining the type of airspace, before a name and limits line. The header line will be covered in the examples, as they're self explanatory. Limits Line The Name and Limits Line defines how this is represented in the database. Limits Line [Ident] [Type] [Airspace Class] [UpperLimit] [LowerLimit] [Optional Export Tag] For example - NZCT Taranaki Only ENR C 99900 FT 0 FT VSYS NZCT-A Taranaki with Ohakea ENR C 99900 FT 0 FT VSPY NTTT Tahiti Oceanic FIR FIR 999 FL NSFA Faleolo FIR FIR 999 FL Ident - As referenced in the Unique Airspace Identifiers section. Type - TMA , ENR or MFIR. Airspace Class - A, C or D. UpperLimit - Upper Limit in either FT or FL. EG 0 FT, 3500 FT, 130 FL. MFIR only has an upper limit. LowerLimit - Lower Limit. As above. Export Tag - As above. Boundary Lines Boundary Lines are defined immediately after the Name and Limits line. Boundary Lines [Ident] [SequenceNum] [Lattitude] [Longitude] [LineType] [ArcDef] For example - NZT001 5 403753.80S 1745231.60E GRC NZT001 6 394745.20S 1744603.20E CWA 401234.58S 1752331.05E 38.00 NM Ident - Must match the ident used in the Name and Limits Line. SequenceNum - A unique line identifier. Starts at 0. Lattitude - Lattitude in eAIP format. Longitude - Longitude in eAIP format. LineType - Either GRC , CCA , CIR , CWA , RHL or FNT . ArcDef - As needed to define an arc or circle. Examples Here are some examples that are currently in our database.

For the Pacific dataset, the primary source is a locally stored copy of the Navigraph database. The ANR data released by Airways is on a 56-day release schedule, usually meaning that the Dataset will vary between a minor and major release every cycle. Minor releases are releases where the ANR has not been updated, and is usually a great time to implement new features or positions or fix errors in the dataset. Major releases are releases where the ANR has been updated, and usually requires a significant rework of locally defined procedures within the dataset. Updating the ANR Data There are two methods of updating the ANR data - automatic and manual. The automatic mode will download the ANR from the AIP website, convert them from PDF to text, before running them against regex patterns to process and import them into the database. Import Process When importing .pdf files, the SFG will first convert them from a PDF to a text file. The SFG then parses that text file. If there are any import errors that need rectification, you should edit the .txt file, not the .pdf or the cleaned txt. Automated Updates The automatic ANR update will download the latest documents from the AIP website, convert them from PDF to Text, before running them against various regex patterns to process and import them into various database tables. To perform an automatic update, navigate to the DB Update tab and click on Extract and Import all eAIP Data . You should now see the progress bar, alongside the file currently being worked. Important It is normal to see various errors during the import process, particularly with the Aerodrome and Airways imports. The SFG will notify you of errors as they occur - so make a note. The error prompt will also notify you of the suggested fix. You will most likely encounter an error when importing the Part 95 Routes file, which contains all airways for both NZZC and NZZO. The error prompt will alert you to the specific Type, Identifier and Sequence that is producing the error. This will require you to manually review and fix the faulting sequence(s). You will then be required to import the amended file through the manual import process. Manual Updates Manual ANR updates are easy, thanks to an automated import. On receipt of an advance copy of the ANR , open the SFG , and navigate to the Utilities screen. Just above the orange Extract button, select the Use ANR Zip File button, then click the orange Extract button. This will then prompt you to select a file. Select the .zip file you have just downloaded. The SFG will then process the files as per an automated import. Updating the Pacific data Due to the Pacific having multiple data sources, it is easier to pull from the Navigraph data. This unfortunately means that the data is always a cycle behind, but it is preferential against having to go digging through the French AIP . To achieve this, the SFG will find the locally stored vatSys copy of the Navigraph data, and will import that depending on various checks. Automatic Update Information As the SFG pulls from the vatSys copy of Navigraph data, you will need to make sure you have the latest version. This can be done by opening vatSys and navigating to Settings > Navigraph > Check for Updates . To perform an automatic update, navigate to the DB Update tab and click on Import Pacific Data . You should now see the progress bar, alongside the file currently being worked. How the data is processed The Pacific data imported, as well as some of the exported data, is filtered by two boundaries defined in AIRAC Testing/SFG Data/NZZC NZZO Check Boundaries.xml . The NZZO Check Boundary is the boundary of the NZZO, NTTT and TSN sectors. Only data that exists within these boundaries are imported from the Navigraph data. The NZZC Check Boundary is a boundary 4nm inside the actual NZZC FIR boundary. This is used during the export process to specifically exclude some of the data from being produced the in the Pacific dataset, such as airways and fixes inside the NZZC. This is located 4nm inside the FIR to ensure that FIR Boundary fixes are exported. There are eAIP formatted versions of these two boundaries in the same data directory that can be adjusted, although it shouldn't be necessary. Solving Errors Occasionally you will get parsing errors where there are errors in the .pdf files. The SFG will alert you to the file that is faulting, and then instruct you to reimport it manually. When editing the text file, ensure you are double checking the parsed PDFtoText file with the original PDF. Common issues include poor formatting, duplicated entries, and mismatched sequences. If you encounter any of these, you should let the author of the PDFs know. After solving the error, you will need to reimport the file manually. You can do this by clicking the corresponding button on the DB Update screen, and then selecting the file.

These must be updated in line with the ANR . The Procedure Editor provides an easy to use interface for creating and editing procedures for the aerodromes contained within the database. The Procedure Editor covers the following procedures - SIDs STARs VFR arrivals and departures Helicopter-specifc procedures (not used) Approaches ( RNP , RNP -AR, LOC and VOR) How does it work? The ProcEd allows the user to create procedures for any of the aerodromes contained within the contl_apt or uncontl_apt tables. Aerodromes not appearing in either of these two tables will not be able to have procedures created for them - regardless of whether or not they appear in other tables, such as ap_aids . After an aerodrome has been added to either of the required tables, it will show under the Airport ICAO dropdown when New Procedure is clicked. The app will automatically pull in the aerodrome's runways, as listed in the runway table. For procedures that have transitions ( SIDs , STARs and approaches), you are required to add the base procedure, and then the various transition routings. This is further defined in the various procedure sections. We have chosen not to model helicopter procedures in New Zealand, due to there are not many helicopter procedures in use around the country; and where helicopter procedures do exist, they are relatively short. What happens on export? On export, the ProcEd largely performs the same actions for both the vatSys and EuroScope releases, but performs and exports them slightly differently. vatSys Each Aerodrome in the contl_apt and uncontl_apt tables are given their own Map folder within the Maps dropdown. The file name XX_ACU is dictated by the icaoabbrv in the relevant table. All of the SIDs , STARs and approaches are rendered on their own map layer, sorted by runway. RNP and RNP -AR approaches are given their own map layers, also sorted by runway. These are also given custom colours, but these are better explained in the individual procedure sections. All VFR arrivals and departures are also given their own map layer, independent of the VRP map layer. Euroscope All procedure layers are rendered into the SIDSTAR section, and are sortable by ICAO. VFR procedures are also rendered in this section. Threshold Fixes In the dataset, custom fixes have been created for each threshold of a runway. These are generated from the runway data provided by the ANR , and don't require any manual attention by the user. They usually follow the format of XXYYT - where XX is the two letter ICAO abbreviation, YY is the runway identifier, and T denotes the threshold. For example, PM07T and PM25T denote the thresholds for Palmerston North's single runway. Where a runway has a R/L designation, the designator will replace the T . For example, AA23L and AA05R denote the thresholds for Auckland. These are mostly used in SIDs , where an origination point is required. These used to be used for approach procedures, but are now appended automatically by the SFG upon dataset export. Exporting a discrete map for a Procedure It is possible to export a separate map layer for a single procedure. This can be helpful for when you want to illustrate changes in procedures to the Dataset's users, and exports the procedure exactly how it would normally be seen within an aerodrome's ACU map layer. To do this, navigate to the procedure you wish to export in the Procedure Editor, and click on the yellow Create map for selected procedure button. You will then be prompted that the file has been exported, and you will be alerted to this file's location.

For example, AA23L and AA05R denote the thresholds for Auckland. These are mostly used in SIDs , where an origination point is required.

These approaches are largely only useful for vatSys, and are used in Euroscope for information only. In vatSys, this data will automatically link with a STAR with a common IAF upon STAR assignment, allowing for route prediction far in advance. These approaches are also given their own map layers - Maps/RNP shows all RNP approaches in the country Maps/RNP-AR shows all RNP -AR approaches in the country Maps/ICAO/XX RNP shows all RNP approaches for that runway Maps/ICAO/XX RNP-AR shows all RNP -AR approaches for that runway For the ICAO-specific maps, there is also an associated labels file that annotates some of the key waypoints. As with the STAR section, the principles of procedure editing laid out in the SID Section are also applicable here - Fixes should be entered in the order in which they are flown. For procedures with transitions, the base procedure should be added first, with the transitions added after. The delete buttons behave in the same way. The general screen layout is the same. Editor Adding a New Procedure Adding a new procedure is relatively simple. RNP should be chosen for normal GNSS based approaches, whereas RNP-AR should be chosen for high-accuracy procedures. This will be stipulated on the chart. An Alpha designator can be added if required. The above image shows the RNP S RWY 23L (AR) approach into Auckland. As you can see, we have new markings next to some of the waypoints. The Black Triangle denotes the approach's Initial Fix (IF). The Maltese Cross denotes the approach's Final Approach Fix (FAF). The Hollow Triangle denotes the approach's or transition's Initial Approach Fix (IAF). These can be designated by highlighting the fix, and clicking the respective button. This does a couple of things - Tells the SFG to create a text label for that waypoint in the various map layers. All points designated as an IF, IAF or FAF will have a label generated. Will assist the SFG in automatically linking STARs and Approaches together in the export. Important You can have multiple waypoints designated as an IAF.

When translating procedures, it is often better to translate them as it they were for the average aircraft. For example, in a performance-influenced departure like the ECHO5 out of Palmerston North, a prop will make a more drastic turn at a lower speed when compared to a faster jet aircraft. Editor The SID Screen The above image shows the screen for a fully populated procedure. The screen is well annotated within the app, although there are a few key things to know about the behaviour of the app - Changing the Runway will update all transitions for that procedure. Changing the Name will update all transitions for that procedure. Changing the Number will update all alphas and transitions for that procedure. Changing the Alpha will update all transitions for that procedure. Changing the Transition will update only the selected procedure. The aircraft type box will alter what aircraft this SID can be made available to in the vatSys FDRs. Ticking the Radar SID box will make the SID the default for non- RNP / RNAV aircraft. Ticking the Default SID box will make it the default SID assigned to traffic for that runway. The Delete this Procedure button will delete the individual procedure selected.

You can add a SID for either a single runway, or all runways at an aerodrome. Where a procedure might be for multiple but not all runways, you should select all. Tip When adding a procedure that has various transitions, you are required to add the base procedure first. This is the part of the procedure that is common to all of the transitions. Usually on charts, this is solid line portion of the procedure. Subsequent transitions can be added by adding a new procedure, entering the base procedure, and then adding the desired transition fix in the Transition box. Clicking Add SID will open to the main screen, where you can add the transition route to the right hand text box. Tip You can also add custom coordinates to create a custom path, or a manual turning point. This is often used for a 500ft turn point, as can be seen in the above illustration of the ECHO5 procedure out of Palmerston North. You can create this point by looking at the procedure in LittleNavMap, displaying the procedure and placing a custom waypoint where the turn commences. This coordinate can then be converted in the SFG 's DMS Conv utility to the SCT format, and can be added like any other fix. The example above shows the RUXOX4S for Runway 07 at Palmerston North.

In order to achieve this, processing is required in advance of the release date which poses a handful of issues, mainly surrounding the fact that the ANR and procedure data isn't made public until the effective date of the AIRAC. Therefore, our working relationship with New Zealand's ANSP is paramount to gaining access to the data early. Step 1 - Find changes The changes being made to data can be found in the Bulletin. This covers changes within the GEN, ENR and AD sections, in addition to covering all AD 2 Chart changes. We use GitHub Issues to track the incoming changes to our data - you can see an example here .

Rotorua : - Some STARs have been renumbered. - Some approach waypoints that have previously been procedural waypoints, have been replaced by IFR waypoints. Christchurch : - Some waypoints on the GNSS approaches have been replaced. There are no changes to the route the approach takes. Amendment to the VFR East arrivals at NZHN. Dataset Updates fix : Slight change in how we notate and program procedures within the SFG app. This has caused: Approaches to be re-labelled RNP and RNP-AR , instead of GNSS and RNP . Threshold fixes for SIDs and Approaches are now handled automatically by the SFG. feat : Heliports have been added to the dataset. fix : Duplicate co-ordinates from Airspace definitions have been removed. feat : SFG now has support for drawing multiple Enroute holds at a single IFR significant point. feat : Dataset now contains all Pacific Ocean position definitions for liaision, in preparation for the Combined Oceanic Dataset. feat : Addition of NZNS_DEL on 123.3. Position Changes Some minor changes to Hamilton positions this cycle. NZHN-R_TWR has been removed, as it has only every been staffed six times. This has allowed for the reallocation of 126.8 as NZHN_TWR's new primary frequency. Hamilton also gains a Delivery frequency this cycle, with a frequency of 122.900, which was previously assigned to NZHN_TWR. This delivery station is a Secondary position - so can be staffed only if Hamilton Tower is online, much the same as NZHN_APP. Nelson Delivery has also been added to the network. This works in much the same way as Hamilton Delivery, and can only be staffed if Nelson Tower is online. Other changes There have been some significant changes to the Sector File Generator tool this past month or so, enabling some neat data to come through in the next couple of cycles. Revision B This revision fixes some Auckland SID resequencing that was missed in Revision A. AIRAC 2203 Revision A ANR Updates There aren't any changes in the ANR this cycle. Dataset Updates fix : RNP approaches now no longer appear in both the RNP and RNP-AR map layers - only the RNP layer. This also extends to each aerodrome's individual approach map layers. fix : (SFG) Removed Threshold fixes from RNP and RNP-AR approaches. This is now performed automatically by the SFG. fix : (SFG) Fixed a bug that meant that some RNP approaches weren't being rendered in the RNP layer, in addition to the Aerodrome folder's RNP map layers. These now show up. AIRAC 2204 Revision A ANR Updates Slight amendments to the FAF for RNAV Z, both RWY 05R/23L. Addiion of T18 , T22 , T80 and KQ461 airways. Addition of a handful of new IFR fixes.

Dataset Updates The following procedures have been redesignated: * NZAA * EXOPI 9B -> EXOPI 1B * BASIV 8B -> BASIV 9B * DAVEE 5B -> DAVEE 6B * UKAPA 1D -> UKAPA 2D * SCARY 1B -> SCARY 2B * PEPPE 4B -> PEPPE 5B * NOBAR 7B -> NOBAR 8B * DAVEE 5D -> DAVEE 6D * PEPPE 7D -> PEPPE 8D * SCARY 1D -> SCARY 2D * NOBAR 7D -> NOBAR 8D * UKAPA 2B -> UKAPA 3B * EAGIL 1A -> EAGIL 2A * FOKRE 1A -> FOKRE 2A * EXOPI 7A -> EXOPI 8A * APABO 2C -> APABO 3C * SKEPY 1A -> SKEPY 2A * APABO 2A -> APABO 3A * NZGS * POPAD 1 -> POPAD 2 * NODEX 1 -> NODEX 2 VSCS Plugin A new VSCS plugin has been added to the Dataset, enabling the Controller to open and control their VSCS panel through a web interface. This plugin opens a local webserver that allows you to access the interface either through your host machine, or through a mobile device on the same local network. The webserver is hosted on the local machine through port 7673 . This means that on your local machine, you can type localhost:7673 into your web browser to find the interface. To access the interface through a networked device, the local machine's local IP address should be used instead of localhost . Special thanks to Zach from VATPAC and Jake from vatSys for working on the plugin. The styles for the plugin have been slightly adjusted for use with the VATNZ dataset. The project data respository can be found here . Revision B (Bug Fixing) The VSCS Plugin released as a part of 2111 Revision A has been withdrawn, as it is causing a crashing issue when switching between datasets. The NZ customised version of the plugin will be available in the future for download, once some additional bugs have been squashed.

Tip Further information can be found in ENR 1.6 - 5, \"ATS Surveillance Services and Procedures\" . VFR Traffic Typically aircraft that are flying under VFR do not transmit a discrete code; instead transmitting a generic type code. There are a few exceptions, such as when they are operating within a controlled aerodrome circuit or are required to be controlled due to manoeuvreing within a Control Zone. Code Range Description 0300 - 0377 Discrete Code range for Controlled VFR aircraft. 1200 Generic code for VFR fixed wing aircraft, when a discrete code has not been issued. 1300 Generic code for gliders and balloons. 1500 Generic code for a VFR helicopter when a discrete code has not been issued. 2200 VFR aircraft operating within a Controlled Aerodrome circuit. 3000 - 3777 Discrete code range for Controlled VFR aircraft. 4000 - 4777 Discrete code range for Controlled VFR aircraft. Tip Discrete squawk codes can be issued to VFR aircraft when operating within a Control Zone. For example, if a Cessna is leaving the zone via the Mangere Bridge departure at Auckland, they can be given a squawk code of 3214 to aid in discrete identification within the TMA . When they leave the control zone, they can keep the discrete code or change to the respective generic code. Aircraft remaining within a Controlled Aerodrome's circuit should squawk 2200. This aids in easy distinction between generic traffic and circuit traffic. Domestic IFR All IFR traffic within the New Zealand FIR is required to transmit a discrete squawk code. This is required to ensure that all traffic can be individually identified on the Controller's radar scope. Code Range Description 2000 Generic code for IFR aircraft not actively managed by an ATC unit. 5000 - 5777 Discrete code range for Domestic IFR aircraft Codes shall be issued to an aircraft during the Clearance Delivery process, and transmitted throughout the duration of their flight. International IFR Traffic All IFR traffic with their destination outside of the New Zealand Domestic FIR are required to transmit a discrete squawk code within the International IFR range. This is required to ensure that all traffic can be individually identified on the Controller's radar scope. Code Range Description 0100 - 0177 Reserve code range for International IFR aircraft. This code range may only be used during high traffic events as authorised by the Events Director, or Operations Director. 0200 - 0277 Discrete code range for International IFR aircraft. 2000 Generic code for IFR aircraft not actively managed by an ATC unit. Codes shall be issued to an aircraft during the Clearance Delivery process, and transmitted throughout the duration of their flight. Tip In the event that aircraft entering the Domestic FIR already has a discrete code issued by an international Controller, that code may be kept. For example - If a Qantas 737 enters the Domestic FIR squawking 1221, which is a discrete code within the Australian international range, they may keep their code provided that no other aircraft has that squawk code. If their code is not unique, then they must be given a unique code before instructions can be given to that aircraft. Military Traffic Code Range Description 6000 - 6477 Discrete code range for Military fixed wing aircraft. 6500 - 6577 Discrete code range for Military helicopters. Military aircraft shall be assigned a discrete code regardless of flight profile. This code shall be assigned when either a VFR or IFR clearance is issued. Military traffic remaining within a controlled aerodrome's circuit should continue to squawk their discrete military code. All foreign military aircraft with their flight originating within New Zealand should also be assigned a code within the military range. If the FMA is crossing into the New Zealand FIR , it is up to the Controller's discretion whether to assign a military squawk or not. Tip Military traffic is relatively common on VATSIM. Because of this, Controllers should familiarize themselves with routinely used callsigns, which can be found under Controller Skills . Formation Flights Unless otherwise instructed by ATC, only the leader is to squawk NORMAL, and all other aircraft are to squawk STANDBY. Military Aircraft Military aircraft formations will be issued a 'base squawk' for the formation flight, with the last number corresponding to the aircraft's formation number.

NZZO-E's area of responsibility is East of the International Date Line. Other real-world Sectors The protrusion at the top of the NZZO FIR actually has three subsectors defined by Airways - the Samoan, Tongan and Cook Sectors. These subsectors are only activated when there is significant traffic in the area that one Oceanic Controller is unable to manage. Even then, they use the same callsign and primary frequency (8.867) as NZZO. Traffic levels on VATSIM rarely get this high, so this split is not warranted. This is also further mitigated by the establishment of NZZO-E_FSS , which can take some of the load off the main sector Controller. Tonga Positions (NF**) TMA NFTF_APP \"Fua'Amotu Tower\" on 118.500 Limits : There are three layers to NFTF_APP's area of responsibility: A circle 23nm in diameter, centered on TBU VOR from SFC to 3,500ft. A circle 75nm in diameter, centered on TBU VOR from 3,500ft to 9,500ft. A circle 100nm in diameter, centered on TBH VOR from 9,500ft to 19,500ft. Fua'Amotu would hand aircraft off to NZZO_FSS upon crossing the boundary. Why is their callsign Tower, not Approach? We've had to implement this position with a _APP suffix, as the FSD restricts _TWR callsigns to a visibility range of 50nm. Towers None! NFTF_TWR is covered by NFTF_APP. AFIS NFTL_FIS : \"Lifuka Radio\" on 118.100. NFTV_FIS : \"Vava'u Flight Service\" on 118.100 This aerodrome weirdly has a Ground service on 121.900, but only an AFIS over top. Niue Positions (NI**) Niue only has a Flight Information Service, providing only traffic information. This will be modelled as NIUE_TWR , with a standard Tower visibility range of 50nm. The Tower is to provide a traffic information service, in addition to relaying IFR clearances from NZZO_FSS. Departing Departing aircraft should make contact with NZZO_FSS upon passing 20DME from NU . If unable to gain contact, they are to remain with NIUE_TWR until they have positive contact. Arriving Arriving aircraft will be given clearance to leave Controlled Airspace on descent through FL245, however should maintain a listening watch on NZZO_FSS. Aircraft should attempt to make contact with NIUE_TWR around 40 DME, and shall report that positive contact to NZZO_FSS before dropping that frequency. NIUE_TWR will report your landing back to NZZO_FSS in order to close your flightplan. Samoa Positions (NS**) This section covers both Western Samoa and American Samoa. Enroute There are no real-world Enroute Sectors operating above Samoa, however due to Samoa's complex Approach sectors and large TMAs, we merge them into a single Faleolo Control Sector. NSFA_CTR : \"Faleolo Control\" on 126.900. Limits : Vertical limits differ. Includes the main sector to the West, and the 'R' sector over Pago Pago. The West Sector is from SFC to FL245. The East Sector is from 3,500ft to FL245. The West Sector provides an Enroute Service for NSFA, and interfaces directly with NSFA. The East Sector provides a TMA service to NSTU, but does not provide a Tower service, as the lower limit is 3,500ft. Tower NSFA_TWR \"Faleolo Tower\" on 118.100 Limits : SFC to 7,500ft. Lateral bounds as shown above. Provides a Procedural Approach service for NSFA. Also provides a control service for NSMA to the west. NSTU NSTU (Pago Pago) is an interesting aerodrome. It is normally uncontrolled, with a combined App/Dep above it, starting at 3,500ft. On the network, this service is to be provided by NSFA_CTR. A tower position will be established on the network for NSTU, as an Event Only position on 122.900. While not incredibly accurate, it will be helpful when an event in underway in the area. The NSTU Clearance position will not be modelled. Cook Islands (NC**) Cook Islands airspace covers a substantial area, which unfortunately cannot be modelled with complete accuracy on the network. Because of this, a solution similar to Samoa would fit nicely. Right Click and open in a new tab to see full detail. Enroute NCRG_CTR \"Rarotonga Control\" on 118.900 Limits : 5,500ft to FL245, with the lateral bounds indicated as above. Roughly 340nm by 260nm. Provides an Enroute radar service within its' lateral bounds. Additionally acts as the Enroute interface between NCRG_APP and either NTTT or NZZO FSS . Provides a top-down service to NCRG when NCRG_APP is offline. TMA NCRG_APP \"Rarotonga Tower\" on 118.100 Limits : There are three layers to NCRG_APP's area of responsibility: A circle of 30nm diameter centered on RG VOR from SFC to 5,500ft. A circle of 50nm diameter centered on RG VOR from 5,500ft to 9,500ft. A circle of 70nm diameter centered on RG VOR from 9,500ft to 14,500ft. Provides a combined Approach/Tower service for NCRG. Wait, another Approach station with a Tower callsign? Similar to NFTF_APP above, we've had to implement this position with a _APP suffix, as the FSD restricts _TWR callsigns to a visibility range of 50nm. NCRG At the moment Rarotonga has a Ground station defined, using a frequency of 121.9, which is Tower's secondary frequency. There's no reason for having a ground station for any reason other than to provide Pre-Departure and Start Clearances.

Oceanic airspace (Class A) starts at FL195, instead of FL245 in NZZO. Outside of the Tower/Approach/Enroute CTAs, the NTTT FIR is Class E from FL045 to FL195. This means that - If you're flying IFR above FL045, you're required to grab an IFR clearance and separation from NTTT_FSS. If you're flying VFR above FL045, you're entitled to a traffic information service. If you're above FL045 within NTTT_CTR's 200nm arc, this service is provided by NTTT_CTR.

This 200nm diameter circle is Class E, where an IFR service is provided, and only a VFR traffic information service is provided. Provides an Enroute/Approach Control service for flights between NTTB (Bora Bora), NTTR (Raiatea), Huahine (NTTH) and Tupai (NTUU). NTTB and NTTR have their own Towers, operating from SFC to 1,500ft. NTTB_TWR also covers NTUU to the north. NTTH is uncontrolled, with the base of NTTT_CTR at 1,500ft. The outer-most ring is the 200nm ring.
